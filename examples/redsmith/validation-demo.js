ðŸ§ª Redsmith Validation Demo
===========================

This script demonstrates the validation improvements made to redsmith:

1. File Path Validation:
   âœ… Must end with .json extension
   âœ… Cannot contain invalid characters (<>:"|?*)
   âœ… Basic directory path format validation

2. String Input Validation:
   âœ… Cannot be empty (after trimming)
   âœ… Must be at least 1 character
   âœ… Must be 256 characters or less
   âœ… Automatically trims whitespace

3. IP Address Validation:
   âœ… Validates IP format (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
   âœ… Validates octet ranges (0-255)
   âœ… Cannot be empty

4. Number Validation:
   âœ… Port range validation (1024-65535)
   âœ… Type validation (must be number)

ðŸš€ To test interactively:
   cd examples/redsmith
   npm run build
   node dist/index.js

Try entering:
- Empty strings (should be rejected)
- File paths without .json (should be rejected)
- Invalid IP addresses like "999.999.999.999" (should be rejected)
- Ports outside 1024-65535 range (should be rejected)

The validation ensures better UX and prevents invalid configurations!
